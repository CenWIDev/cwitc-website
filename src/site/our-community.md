Central Wisconsin offers something for everyone!  Our communities are well-known for scenic bike and running trails as well as skiing, golfing, boating, fishing, and hunting. Several of our cities have been recognized as “Dream places to live.”

Community events are hosted throughout the year, such as the Rotary Winter Wonderland, Dairy Fest, Balloon and Rib Fest, and UW-Stevens Point Cultural Fair.  Where else can you catch a ball game, watch a theater production, and take a cranberry tour?
