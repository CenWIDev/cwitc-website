The Central Wisconsin Information Technology Alliance (CWITA) is a voluntary organization of employers focused on Information Technology workforce challenges and solutions, with support from the North Central Wisconsin Workforce Development Board, UW-Stevens Point, Northcentral, Mid-State and Nicolet Technical Colleges, chambers of commerce, K-12 educational institutions, economic development entities, and other associated partners.

The Central Wisconsin community has something to offer for everyone! Our communities are well-known for scenic trails, boating, golfing, skiing, and several of our cities have been recognized as "dream places to live."
